Thank you for downloading InkBlot's Tifa. This is my first FF7 skin, but I am pleased 
with it. This is the first time I've been pleased with the model that I used here. I 
hope to do more FF7 skins, but for now all I can do is suggest a really good FF7 model 
to you. Aeris, by Cloud. The only flaw is the fact that she is wearing a skirt, but 
other than that the model is the best Aeris model I've ever seen. If you have any 
comments or suggestions, please E-Mail me at pendragon666@worldnet.att.net or post a 
review at WON. Thank you.
